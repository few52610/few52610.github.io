			<p>The Fender Musical Instruments Corporation, known by many as just "Fender", is a manufactuar of stringed instruments and amplifiers. Founded in Fullerton, California 1946 by Clarence Leonidas "Leo" Fender, Fender has become one of the leading producers of musicial instruments, especially their solid body electric guitars. In the late 1940's there were only a few electic guitar manufactures, but Fender's new solid body electric guitars, starting with the Telecaster, provided durability, versitility, and afordability. </p>
                <p> Believe it or not, Leo Fender was not a musician, he was just a very qualified electronics technician with a keen ability to develop instruments with percesion, attenton to detail, quick assembly, and mass production and distribution like no one had ever seen. With top notch marketing strategies that paired fun and popular activites, like surfing, to playing guitar, and with great photography to tie it all together, Fender was able to connect to a huge demographic. </p>

          <P> Although Fender does produces more than just electric guitars, a vast majority of their sucees can be attributed to their solid budy electric guitars. The first design was the Telecaster, then the Stratocaster (which is considered their most popular brand), next came the Jazzmaster, then the Jaguar, and finally the Mustang. Each one has had a unique influence on music since their development.</P>
